## APPENDIX D â€“ MATLAB SCRIPTS DEVELOPED FOR THIS RESEARCH

The main MATLAB scripts developed for ground motion modeling, spectral acceleration analysis, and statistical evaluation of GMPEs are available in the following public repository:

ðŸ”— **GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/jpreyes/thesis-matlab-scripts](https://github.com/jpreyes/thesis-matlab-scripts)

### Included Scripts:

- `GMPE_MBR17.m` â€“ Main script to compute spectral acceleration values (Sa) using the GMPE proposed by Montalva et al. (2017), with full vector support and log-log interpolation.
- `CH_MBR17_CoefModel.m` â€“ Core implementation of the GMPE model, returning Sa and associated statistical components (Ïƒ, Ï•, Ï„) across periods.
- `CH_MBR17_PGA1000.m` â€“ Auxiliary function to compute PGA at Vs30 = 1000 m/s, required for nonlinear site amplification when Vs30 < vlin.
- `GMPEFit.m` â€“ Fits a smoothing spline to empirical data of ln(Sa) versus Rhyp, and generates residual plots for model validation.
- `generateSyntheticSeismicSignal1.m` â€“ Script to generate a synthetic seismic acceleration time-history with Gaussian pulse envelope and white noise.
- `signal_analysis_roof_directions.m` â€“ Reads and analyzes roof-level seismic responses in X, Y, and RZ directions using spectrograms, periodograms, and Yule-Walker estimators to assess modal energy evolution and damage effects.

All scripts are distributed under the **MIT License**.  
The repository also includes example datasets, coefficient tables, and plotting routines for visualization and model comparison.
